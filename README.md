# Curriculum_Examples
Examples of curriculum material I've designed

### Curriculum_Overview.PDF
* Page 2-3 preview of the FSM Onboarding Curriculum guide.
* Collaborated with team to create entire program from scratch.

### DBMS.PDF
* A PDF print-out view (which is why the formatting looks off) of a DBMS quiz that doubles as a course.  People learn as they work through this intuitive hands-on experience.
* Originally is on MS forms with branching.  Sufficient for it's purpose and more efficient than creating an SAP LMS.
* Inspired by _Learn Python The Hard Way_ by Zed Shaw.

### MS_STREAM.PNG
* Snippet of some screen capture tutorials I created to accomodate non-literary learners on more complex processes and tips for job tasks. 
* Everything exists as a written version in the SOP I created.  Videos are created when I have time for topics that are highly requested.

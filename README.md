# Curriculum_Examples
Examples of curriculum material I've designed

### DBMS.PDF
* A PDF print-out view (which is why the formatting looks off) of a DBMS quiz that doubles as a course.  People learn as they work through this intuitive hands-on experience.
* Originally is on MS forms with branching.  Sufficient for it's purpose and more efficient than creating an SAP LMS.
* Inspired by _Learn Python The Hard Way_ by Zed Shaw.
